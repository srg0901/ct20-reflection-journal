This week's project was challenging for me because I'm still geting comfortable with p5.js and thinking about time
in a nontraditional way. I had to watch a few tutorials and revisit example to better understand how motion
color, and real-time values could work together without relying on number or clocks hands.
Once I understood the basics, I focused on keeping the sketch simple while still commicating the passage of a full day
through slow movement and color changes. This project helped me think differently about time as something that can be felt 
and experienced rather than being perfect. I was also challenged to problem-sove and experiment more than I usually do.
